          I have been working out since July 2022. Since then, I have made many

          The gym has been a place where I can relax and destress. I've always
          had that relationships with sports since I was young. Since I was
          seven years old I attended a judo club at least once a week. This club
          taught me many lifeskills like discpline and commitment.

          Below are a collection of images from my recent time at the gym. While
          some may say that taking photos of oneself at the gym is narracistic
          and self obssesed I think its important. Without these photos I would
          not be able to see what progress I have made and what differences I
          have overcome.
