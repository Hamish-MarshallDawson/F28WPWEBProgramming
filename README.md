This version of the website has added a main home.html page and a Style_sheet for external css 



This commit had an added libary of gym pictures of how my progress has recently increased. Thes images are all added to a file.

Css is setup in a way that the site has a main background colour and all other elements are in a seperat div with a border acting like a shadow. This adds some artificial depth to the webpages.
